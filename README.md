# Project 2 crowdfunding_ETL
## Overview
For this ETL project, our goal was to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Once the table schema was created, we loaded into a Postgres database along with the CSV file data.

## Project Structure
This project was split into four sections:
	- Creating the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
	- Creating the Campaign DataFrame
	- Creating the Contacts DataFrame
	- Creating the Crowdfunding Database
